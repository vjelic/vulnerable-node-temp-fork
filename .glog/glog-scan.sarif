This is particularly risky because URIs can be logged, cached, or otherwise exposed in ways that are not secure. In JavaScript applications, this can lead to unintended credential exposure if the URI is logged or shared.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Avoid Embedding Credentials in URIs**: Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information securely.\n2. **Use Secure Connections**: Always use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to encrypt data in transit.\n3. **Implement Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.\n4. **Regularly Rotate Credentials**: Change passwords and other credentials regularly to minimize the risk of exposure.\n5. **Audit and Monitor**: Regularly audit logs and monitor for any unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the credentials are embedded directly in the URI. To fix this, you should refactor the code to use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.\n\n#### Original Code\n\n```javascript\n\"text\": \"                    \\\"text\\\": \\\"                    \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"                    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"server\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"postgres://postgres:postgres@10.211.55.70\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\"\n```\n\n#### Refactored Code\n\n```javascript\nconst dbUser = process.env.DB_USER;\nconst dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;\nconst dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;\n\nconst connectionString = `postgres://${dbUser}:${dbPassword}@${dbHost}`;\n\n// Use the connectionString securely in your application\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example provided does not require any specific library dependencies to execute properly.

This can lead to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the GitHub Actions runner. In the provided code snippet, the use of `${{ inputs.lang }}`, `${{ inputs.ignore }}`, and `${{ inputs.client }}` without proper sanitization or escaping can be exploited if these inputs are controlled by an attacker.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs before using them in shell commands. Ensure that inputs conform to expected patterns or values.\n2. **Use Safe APIs**: Prefer using APIs or libraries that handle input safely, avoiding direct shell command execution when possible.\n3. **Escape Inputs**: If shell execution is necessary, ensure that inputs are properly escaped to prevent injection.\n4. **Least Privilege**: Run scripts with the least privilege necessary to limit the impact of a potential injection.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability, ensure that inputs are properly escaped or validated. Here's a revised version of the code:\n\n```yaml\nrun: |\n        TOOL_CMD=\"${{ github.action_path }}/glog.sh scan --path $GITHUB_WORKSPACE\"\n        ARGS=()\n        if [ ! -z \"${{ inputs.lang }}\" ]; then\n          ARGS+=(\"--lang\" \"$(printf '%q' \"${{ inputs.lang }}\" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]//g')\")\n        fi\n        if [ ! -z \"${{ inputs.ignore }}\" ]; then\n          ARGS+=(\"--ignore\" \"$(printf '%q' \"${{ inputs.ignore }}\" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]//g')\")\n        fi\n        if [ ! -z \"${{ inputs.client }}\" ]; then\n          ARGS+=(\"--client\" \"$(printf '%q' \"${{ inputs.client }}\" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]//g')\")\n        fi\n        $TOOL_CMD \"${ARGS[@]}\"\n```\n\nIn this fix, a `sed` command is used to strip out any characters that are not alphanumeric, underscores, or hyphens, which helps prevent injection.\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example provided is a shell script executed within a GitHub Actions workflow, and it does not directly depend on any JavaScript libraries. However, it assumes the presence of a shell environment and standard Unix utilities like `sed`.\n\n### Relevant Resources\n\n- [OWASP Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)\n- [CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)"

This can lead to unauthorized access if the code is exposed or logged, as the credentials are easily extractable. In the provided example, the URI contains hardcoded credentials for a PostgreSQL database, which is a security risk.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the source code.\n2. **Configuration Files**: Use configuration files that are not included in version control to store sensitive information.\n3. **Secrets Management Tools**: Utilize secrets management tools such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely store and access credentials.\n4. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls and audit logging to monitor access to sensitive information.\n5. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo fix the vulnerability, remove the hardcoded credentials from the URI and use environment variables to securely manage them. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:\n\n```javascript\n// Load environment variables\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\n// Construct the database URI using environment variables\nconst dbUser = process.env.DB_USER;\nconst dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;\nconst dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;\nconst dbName = process.env.DB_NAME;\n\nconst dbURI = `postgres://${dbUser}:${dbPassword}@${dbHost}/${dbName}`;\n\n// Use the dbURI in your application\nconsole.log(`Database URI: ${dbURI}`);\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the code example properly, you need the following library:\n\n- `dotenv`: This library is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.\n\nYou can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install dotenv\n```\n\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)\n- [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)"

However, if you are using a database client library, you might need to include it. For example, if you are connecting to a PostgreSQL database, you would typically use the `pg` library:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\nnpm install pg\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\\\\n\\\\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\\\\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)\\\\n\\\\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\\\\n\\\\n- [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)\\\\n- [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)\\\"\""
